# MLB Playoffs qualification: A Data Science perspective

This was my second project in my Data Science course. The requirements were as shown below: 

The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules. Select a data set and analyse it using the techniques learned in recent modules. Prepare and present a 10-minute PowerPoint presentation and a 5-minute jupyter notebook presentation in class.

Things to consider:
1. Application of your choice
2. Dataset that is not tidy (minimum 1000 observations, minimum 12-13 features)
3. Feature selection
4. Visualization
5. Machine learning models (at least 2 regression models)
6. Performance metric
7. Hyperparameter tuning (Optional)
8. Comparison between models

In this assignement, I worked with logistic and linear regression models.
